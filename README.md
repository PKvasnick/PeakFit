# PeakFit - Notebooks for simple peak fitting and replication of spectra

The `PeakFit_dev.ipynb` notebook replaces the spectrum fitting procedure of the software installed on lab PCs and is intended for use in lab practice assignments during the distance learning period(s).

The `PeakGen.ipynb` notebook generates replicas (differing by counting noise and scale) from a template set of spectra.
